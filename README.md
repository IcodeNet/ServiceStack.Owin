[View the latest spec.html](http://owin.github.com/spec.html).

## Road Map 
Eventually this project will contain sufficient adapters for web frameworks like [ServiceStack](https://github.com/mythz/ServiceStack) to run on OWIN-compatible hosts like the [Kayak HTTP Server](https://github.com/kayak/kayak).
